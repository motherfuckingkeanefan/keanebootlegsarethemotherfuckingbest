            <h2>Seriously, if you think studio albums are better, you're an idiot.</h2>
            <h3>3 reasons.</h3>
            <p>That's how many bulletproof points it takes to prove that Keane's live bootlegs wipe the floor with their studio albums. Let's cut the crap and get into it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bootlegs capture the raw, unfiltered energy you just can't fake in a studio.</li>
                <li>They're unpredictable—every show is a new fucking experience.</li>
                <li>You get to <a href="audio/HearTheBandScrewUp.mp3" onclick="playTrack('HamburgSong')">hear the band screw up</a>, and guess what? It's glorious.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real, Raw Emotion</h2>
            <p>Studio albums are polished turds. Keane's live performances, captured in bootlegs, are dripping with authenticity. That raw emotion? That's what music is all about.</p>
            <h2>Unpredictable Perfection</h2>
            <p>Ever <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0MlTOiC5ZYKFGeZ8h3D4rd">listen to Hopes and Fears</a> and think, "Wow, this is exactly the same as the last hundred times I heard it?" That's because it's boring and predictable. Bootlegs are where the magic happens. Each one is a unique experience.</p>
            <h2>Beautiful Imperfections</h2>
            <p>Keane screws up during live shows, and it's fucking fantastic. Those mistakes and spontaneous moments are what make their live bootlegs superior. If you think perfection is a perfectly mixed track, you're delusional.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Real Fucking Deal</h2>
            <p>In case it’s not clear yet, live bootlegs capture the essence of Keane’s live performances. That energy can't be polished in a studio. So <a href="audio/StopPretending.mp3" onclick="playTrack('SomewhereOnlyWeKnow')">stop pretending</a> and <a href="audio/EmbraceTheMagic.mp3" onclick="playTrack('UnderPressure')">embrace the magic</a>. Keane bootlegs are where the real experience lies.</p>

            <h2>Final Fucking Words</h2>
            <p>If you're still convinced studio albums are the shit, maybe it's time to <a href="audio/WakeTheFuckUp.mp3" onclick="playTrack('Bedshaped')">wake the fuck up</a>. But hey, if you wanna argue or need more proof, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/pieterhoutekame">X</a>.</p>
